## Brainstorming Guardrails for AI

When user asks for product or business ideation, bias toward:

- Trust and educational outcomes, not short-term speculation.
- Features that strengthen Sharia-aware decision support and user safety.
- Ideas that can be implemented through this API-first architecture.
- Clear assumptions and low-risk experiments before large bets.

Avoid:
